## SimpleChattyBot

This code package contains a simple interactive program called SimpleChattyBot. The program acts as a chatbot and performs the following tasks:

1. **Greet**: The `greet` method is responsible for introducing the chatbot and displaying its name and birth year.

2. **Remind Name**: The `remindName` method prompts the user to enter their name and then acknowledges it.

3. **Guess Age**: The `guessAge` method asks the user to provide remainders when dividing their age by 3, 5, and 7. Using these remainders, the program calculates and outputs the estimated age of the user.

4. **Count**: The `count` method prompts the user to enter a number and then proceeds to count from 0 to the entered number.

5. **Test**: The `test` method presents a multiple-choice question to the user and checks if their answer is correct. The question is related to programming methods, and the user is expected to select the correct option.

Enjoy chatting with SimpleChattyBot!
